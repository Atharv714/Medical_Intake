## REFERRALS

- PSYCHIATRIST: The patient is experiencing symptoms of depression such as difficulty concentrating, feelings of sadness, restlessness, indifference, and hopelessness. The psychiatrist should conduct a thorough mental health evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment. The psychiatrist should also assess the patient's risk of self-harm given the reported feelings of hopelessness.

- PSYCHOLOGIST: The patient could benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy or other forms of psychotherapy to help manage symptoms and develop coping strategies. The psychologist should work in conjunction with the psychiatrist to provide comprehensive mental health support.

## LABS & TESTS

- COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC): This test can help rule out physical causes of the patient's symptoms such as anemia or infection, which can cause fatigue and difficulty concentrating.

- THYROID FUNCTION TESTS: Hypothyroidism can cause symptoms such as fatigue and depression. These tests can help rule out this condition as a cause of the patient's symptoms.

- VITAMIN B12 AND FOLATE LEVELS: Deficiencies in these vitamins can cause symptoms of fatigue and depression. These tests can help rule out these deficiencies as a cause of the patient's symptoms. 

- SLEEP STUDY: Given the patient's reported trouble staying asleep, a sleep study could help identify any underlying sleep disorders such as insomnia or sleep apnea, which could contribute to the patient's symptoms of exhaustion and difficulty concentrating.
